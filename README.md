To run page go to CS765FinalProject/CS765/DesignChallenge.html

This is a pre built project (I included all builds) so it should work for you automatically. I did test on another computer and it ran as expected. 

Has been tested in Chrome, and ran in Safari. 

You can use the provided *.csv files in the CS765FinalProject/CS765/data/ folder or upload your own *.csv (numerical only) file. The page will show you 3 sizes of the same parallel coordinates data. The data will be limited to the first 10 columns and 100 rows (chosen by random).

There are directions on the html page. 

I used this library:
